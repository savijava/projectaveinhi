</head>

<body>
    <div>
        <h2>BackTracking is a form of recursion. </h2>
        <p>The usual scenario is tha you are faced with a number od options and you must choose one of these.After you
            make your choice you will get a new set of optios;just what set of options you get depends on what choice
            ,your final state is a goal state;if you didn't,it isn't.</p>
        <p>Conceptually,you start at the root of a tree;the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad
            leaves,though it may be that the leaves are all good oe all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each
            node,beginning with the root,you choode one of its children to move tp,and you keep this up until you get to
            a leaf.</p>
        <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf.You can back track to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most
            recent choice,and trying out the next option in that sets of options. If you run out of Options,revoke the
            choice that got you here,and try another choice at that node.If you end up at the root with no options
            left,there are no good leaves to be found.</p>
        <p>This needs an example.</p>
        <img src="./Image_root.png" alt="image root">
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Starting at Root,y options are A and B. You choose A</li>
            <li>AtA,your options are C and D.You choose C.</li>
            <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
            <li>At A, you have already tried C,and it failed.Try D.</li>
            <li>D is bad.o back to A.</li>
            <li>At Root,you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
            <li>At B,your options are E and F.Try E.</li>
            <li>E is good. Congratulations</li>

        <div style="border: 0.5px solid gainsboro; background-color: gainsboro; border-radius: 20px;">
            <p> In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model of the possible sequences of
                choices we could make. There is also a data structure called a tree, but usually we don't have a data
                structure to tell us what choices we have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on
                it is called depth-first tree searching.)</p>

        <h4>The backtracking algorithm.</h4>
        <div style="border: 2px solid gainsboro; border-radius: 20px;">
            <pre>
            boolean solve(Node n){
                if n is a leaf node{
                    if the leaf is a goal node,retun true
                    else return false
                }else{
                    for each child c of n{
                        if solve(c) succeeds,return true
                    }
                    return false
                }
            }
        </pre>
        </div><br>
        <div style="border: 2px solid gainsboro; border-radius: 20px; background-color: gainsboro;">
            <p>Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a boolean function. This is essential to understanding the
                algorithm. If solve(n) is true, that means node n is part of a solution--that is, node n is one of the
                nodes on a path from the root to some goal node. We say that n is solvable. If solve(n) is false, then
                there is no path that includes n to any goal node.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How does thi work?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If any child of n is solvable,then n is solvable.</li>
            <li>If no child of n is solvable,the n is not solvable.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable (part of a path to a goal node), all you have to do
            is test whether any child of n is solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above code,
            this is done by the lines</p>
        <div style="border: 1px solid gainsboro; border-radius: 20px;">
            <pre>
        for each child c of n{
            if solve(c) suceeds,return true
        }
        return false
        </pre>
        </div>
        <p>Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out at a leaf node. If the leaf node is a goal node, it is solvable;
            if the leaf node is not a goal node, it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is
            done by the lines</p>
        <div style="border: 2px solid gainsboro;">
            <pre>if n is a leaf node{
            if the leaf is agoal node,return true 
            else return false
         }
        </pre>
        </div>
        <p>The backtracking algorithm is simple but important.You should understand it thoroghlt. Another way of statin
            it as follows:</p>
        <h3>To search a tree:</h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>If the tree consists of a single leaf,test whether it is a goal node.</li>
            <li>Otherwise,search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal node,or until you have searched them
                all unsuccessfully.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Non-recursive backtracking,using a stack</h3>
        <p>Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recursive algorithm can be rewritten as a stack
            algorithm. In fact, that is how your recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.
        </p>
        <div style="border:1px solid gainsboro;border-radius: 20px;">
            <pre>
            boolean solve(Node n){
                put node n on the stack;
                while the stack is not empty{
                    if the node at te top of the stack is aleaf{
                        if ot is a goal node,return true
                        else pop it off the stack
                    }
                    else{
                        if the node at the top of the stack has untries children 
                        push the next untried child onto the stack 
                    }
                    return false
                }
            }
        </pre>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack are the children of the node
                currently on the top of the stack, and these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence, the nodes on
                the stack at all times describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed from the stack only when it
                is known that they have no goal nodes among their descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed
                (making the stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and no solution to the
                problem.<br><br>
                When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack form (in reverse order) a path
                from the root to a goal node.<br><br> Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node, the
                path
                information is embodied (in reverse order) in the sequence of recursive calls. Thus as the recursion
                unwinds, the path can be recovered one node at a time, by (for instance) printing the node at the
                current level, or storing it in an array. <br><br>Here is the recursive backtracking algorithm, modified
                slightly to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the successful path:

            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <pre>
            boolean solve(Node n){
                if n is a leaf node{
                    if the leaf is a goal node{
                        print n
                        return true
                    }
                    else return false
                }else{
                    for each child c of n {
                        if slove(c) succeeds{
                            print n
                            return true
                        }
                    }
                    return false
                }
            }
        </pre>
        </div>
        <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
        <div>
            <p>All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple, but when applied to a real
                problem, they can get pretty cluttered up with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can
                be complex:<br><br> for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame problem,
                the leaves are the checkmate and stalemate solutions<br><br> To keep the program clean, therefore, tests
                like this should be buried in methods. In a chess game, for example, you could test whether a node is a
                leaf by writing a <b>gameOver method</b> (or you could even call it isLeaf). This method would
                encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out whether any possible moves remain.<br><br>Notice that
                the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for each node on the current path, which of its
                children have been tried already (so we don't have to try them again). In the above code we made this
                look simple, by just saying for each child c of n. In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what
                the possible children are, and there may be no obvious way to step through them. In chess, for example,
                a node can represent one arrangement of pieces on a chessboard, and each child of that node can
                represent the arrangement after some piece has made a legal move. How do you find these children, and
                how do you keep track of which ones you've already examined? <br><br>The most straightforward way to
                keep track of which children of the node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the node
                (that is, when you first get there from above), make a list of all its children. As you try each child,
                take it off the list. When the list is empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can
                return "failure." This is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of additional work.<br><br>
                There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried, if you can define an ordering on
                the children. If there is an ordering, and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which
                child to try next. <br><br>For example, you might be able to number the children 1 through n, and try
                them in numerical order. Then, if you have just tried child k, you know that you have already tried
                children 1 through k-1, and you have not yet tried children k+1 through n. Or, if you are trying to
                color a map with just four colors, you can always try red first, then yellow, then green, then blue. If
                child yellow fails, you know to try child green next. If you are searching a maze, you can try choices
                in the order left, straight, right (or perhaps north, east, south, west).<br><br> It isn't always easy
                to find a simple way to order the children of a node. In the chess game example, you might number your
                pieces (or perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order; but in addition each piece
                may also have several moves, and these must also be ordered. You can probably find some way to order the
                children of a node. If the ordering scheme is simple enough, you should use it; but if it is too
                cumbersome, you are better off keeping a list of untried children.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Example: Tree Search</h3>
        <div>
            <p>
                For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking, which is searching an actual tree.
                We will also use the simplest kind of tree, a binary tree. <br><br>A binary tree is a data structure
                composed of nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can reference (point to) zero,
                one, or two other nodes, which are called its children. The children are referred to as the left child
                and/or the right child. All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and there are
                no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the definition of a binary tree, we will say
                that a node might or might not be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first example in this
                paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree.<br><br>Here's a definition of the BinaryTree class:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div style="border: 1px solid gainsboro;">
            <pre>
                public class BinaryTree{
                    BinaryTree leftChild=null;
                    BinaryTree rightChild=null;
                    boolean is GoalNode=false;
                    String name;
                    BinaryTree(String name,Tree left,BinaryTree right,boolean isGoalNode){
                        this.name-name;
                        leftChild=left;
                        rightChild=right;
                        this.isGoalNode=isGoalNode;
                    }
                }
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>Next we wiil create a TreeSearch class,and in it we will define a method makeTree() ehich constructs the
            above binary tree.</p>
        <div style="border: 1px solid gainsboro; color: rgb(85, 85, 145);">
            <pre>
            static BinaryTree makeTree(){
                BinaryTree root,a,a,b,c,d,e,f;  
                c=newBinaryTree("C",null,null,false);
                d=newBinaryTree("D",null,null,false);
                return root;
            }
        </pre>
        </div>
        <p>Here's a main program to cretae a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
        <div style="border: 1px solid gainsboro; color: burlywood;">
            <pre>
                public static void main(String args[]){
                    BinaryTree tree =makeTree();
                    System.out.println(solvable(tree));
                }
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>And finally .here's the recursive backtracking o "solve" the binary tree by finding a goal node.</p>
        <div style="border:1px solid gainsboro;">
            <pre>
                static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){
                    /*1/if (node==null)return false;
                    /*2/ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
                    /*3/ if(solvable(node.leftChild))return true;
                    /*4/ if(solvable(node.rightChild))return true;
                    /*5*/ return false;

                }
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>Here's what the numbered lines are doing:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with
                the children of a node, without first checking whether those children actually exist.</li>
            <li>If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.</li>
            <li>See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get
                to this line if node is non-null and is not a goal node, says to</li>
            <li>Do the same thing for the right child.</li>
            <li>Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.</p>
        <p>Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the
            first thing in solvable. An alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if
            they do. Here's that alternative version:</p>
        <div style="border: 1px solid gainsboro;">
            <pre>
            static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node){
                if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
                if (node.leftChild!=null && solvable(node.rightChild)) return true;
                return false;
            }
        </pre>
        </div>
        <p>I think the first version is simpler, but the second version is slightly more efficient.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>What are the childern?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that, at each choice point, you can
                ignore all the previous choices. Previous choices don't give you any information about what you should
                do next; as far as you know, both the left and the right child are possible solutions. In many problems,
                however, you may be able to eliminate children immediately, without recursion. Consider, for example,
                the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter
                how convoluted the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no two countries that
                share a border are the same color. To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a
                color for the second country, and so on, until all countries are colored. There are two ways to do this:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check
                    whether you are at a goal node.</li>
                <li>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur.
                    If and when you run out of countries, you have successfully colored the map.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If
                and when you run out of countries, you have successfully colored the map.</p>
        </div>
        <div>boolean <b>mapIsOK()</b> Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored

        <p>The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less than 1 millisecond). Why this huge
            difference? Either of these methods could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically
            eliminates all of its descendents, and this will often prevent exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to
            check until a leaf node is reached, exponential growth is practically guaranteed. If there is any way to
            eliminate children (reduce the set of choices), do so!</p>

        <h3>Debugging techniques</h3>
        <p>Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it. Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes
            we need to fall back on inserting print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use of
            print statements. These tricks can be applied to any program, but are especially useful when you are trying
            to debug recursive routines.</p>
        <p>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.<br><br> Often, the best debugging technique is to
            print every method call and return (or at least the most important ones). You probably want to print, for
            each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value it leaves with. However, if you just print a
            long list of these, it's hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries. Indenting to show
            the level of nesting can help.</p>
        <p>Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.<br><br> Don't clutter up your actual code more than
            you must. Also, remember that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself contain bugs, or (in the worst
            case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.</p><br><br>
        <p>Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more debugging code than actual code, but
            in larger programs the proportions will be better.</p><br><br>
        <p>To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:</p>
        <div style="border: 1px solid gainsboro; color: blue;">
            <pre>
                static boolean solvable(BinaryTree node) { enter(node); if (node == null) return no(node); if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node); if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return yes(node); if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node); return no(node); }
            </pre>
        </div>
        <p>And we get these results:</p>
        <div>
            <pre>Entering solvable(Root)
                 | Entering solvable(A) 
                 | | Entering solvable(C) 
                 | | | Entering solvable(null) 
                 | | | solvable(null) returns false 
                 | | | Entering solvable(null) 
                 | | | solvable(null) returns false 
                 | | solvable(C) returns false 
                 | | Entering solvable(D) 
                 | | | Entering solvable(null) 
                 | | | solvable(null) returns false 
                 | | | Entering solvable(null) 
                 | | | solvable(null) returns false 
                 | | solvable(D) returns false 
                 | solvable(A) returns false 
                 | Entering solvable(B) 
                 | | Entering solvable(E) 
                 | | solvable(E) returns true 
                 | solvable(B) returns true solvable(Root) returns true 
                   true

        <p><b>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</b></p><br><br>
        <p>If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it happened by sending it the message
            printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your
            own Exceptions. However, Java programmers don't always realize that you can create an Exception without
            throwing it. For example, the following code</p>

        <p>I call the following puzzle "Cindy's puzzle" for historical reasons. You have some number n of black marbles
            and the same number of white marbles, and you have a playing board which consists simply of a line of 2n+1
            spaces to put the marbles in. Start with the black marbles all at one end (say, the left), the white marbles
            all at the other end, and a free space in between.</p>

            The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy. Now to the program. The main program will initialize the board, and call a recursive backtracking routine to attempt to solve the puzzle.<br> The backtracking routine will either succeed and print out a winning path, or it will fail, and the main program will have to print out the bad news. The backtracking method is named solvable and returns a boolean. In solvable we shall need to check whether we are at a leaf, which in this case means a position from which no further moves are possible. This isn't so easy.<br> Each possible move will result in a new board position, and these new board positions are the children of the current board position. Hence to find the children of a node (that is, of a board position), we need only find the possible moves from that node. Remember that it is also highly desirable to find an ordering on these possible moves.<br> Here it is time to stop and take thought. To make progress, we must analyze the game to some extent. Probably a number of approaches would work, and what follows is based on the way I worked it out. If you were to program this puzzle, you might find a different but equally valid approach. First, notice that if a marble has a move, that move is unique: if it can move ahead one square, then it cannot jump. If it can jump, it cannot move ahead one square.<br> This suggests that, to find the possible moves, we might assign numbers to the marbles, and check each marble in turn. When we have looked at all the marbles, we have looked at all the possible moves. This would require having a table to keep track of where each marble is, or else somehow "marking" each marble with its number and searching the board each time to find the marble we want. Neither alternative is very attractive. Next, notice that for a given board position, each marble occupies a unique space. <br>Hence, instead of talking about moving a particular marble, we can talk about moving the marble in a particular space. If a move is possible from a given space, then that must be the only move possible from that space, because if the marble in that space has a move, it is unique. There is a slight complication because not every space contains a marble, but at least the spaces (unlike the marbles) stay in one place.

            We write another method <b>int[] makeMove(int[] oldBoard, int position)</b> that will take a board and a position, make a move from that position, and return as its value a new board. (We could write this somewhat more efficiently by changing the old board, rather than creating a new one, but here we are more concerned with simplicity.) In technical jargon, makeMove is "applicative" rather than "mutative."<br> Along with <b>canMove and makeMove</b>, we are using methods puzzleSolved and printBoard with meanings that should be obvious. With these methods, our central backtracking method can be written as follows:

                        if (canMove(board, position)) { 
                            int[] newBoard = makeMove(board, position); 
                            if (solvable(newBoard)) {
                                 printBoard(newBoard);
